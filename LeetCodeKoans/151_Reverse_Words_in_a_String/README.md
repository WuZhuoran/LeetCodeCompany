# [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)

## Description

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,    
Given s = "`the sky is blue`",    
return "`blue is sky the`".

**Clarification:**
* What constitutes a word?    
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.

* Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?    
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

* How about multiple spaces between two words?    
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
