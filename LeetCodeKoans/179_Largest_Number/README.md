# [179. Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/)

## Description

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

For example, given `[3, 30, 34, 5, 9]`, the largest formed number is `9534330`.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
