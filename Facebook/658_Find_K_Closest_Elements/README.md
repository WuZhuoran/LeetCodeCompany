# [658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/description/)

## Description

Given a sorted array, two integers `k` and `x`, find the `k` closest elements to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

**Example 1:**    
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**    
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Note:**    
1. The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
2. Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10^4
3. Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10^4
